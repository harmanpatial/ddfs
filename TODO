TODO:

1. Create sub directories for each specific module.
2. Decide and implement a leader selection algorithm.
3. Focus on making the whole project modular.
4. Decide on the protocol to use. Most probably on top of UDP.
5. Creating the network engine that would handle the packets.

Long term goals

1. Establish trade offs and make decisions.
2. Make sure that we understand the tradeoffs and how to approach them.

EVERTHING IS FOCUSED TOWARDS WHAT KIND OF NETWORK AND DATA WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH.
